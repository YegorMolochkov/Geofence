How it works:
Right after launch you need to set-up point with center of the area. Once you'll finish backround color will change

1) Area radius selection (default radius is 100 meters). Right after pressing "done" on keyboard changes will apply.
2) Place pick button, by pressing on it you will redirect to place picker to choose center point of area.
3) WiFi name, you can change desired wifi name here. Right after pressing "done" on keyboard changes will apply.
